These are all relatively simple AI scripts created from working through d2l.ai using pytorch. 

sinetest.py - Tries to fit a sine function to a linear model.
utilitysinetest.py - Same as sinetest.py, but uses more of pytorch's utilities.
emnisttest.py - Uses a single layer classifier to analyze emnist data.
concise_emnist.py - Same as emnisttest.py, but uses more of pytorch's utilities.
